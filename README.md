# RacingLineOptimiser
GUI to determine racing line of a given set of track coordinates
Really simple project to teach myself OOP GUI creation, which has the following features:
- Upload track cooridinates using filemanager
- Automatic offsetting of track centre line to gain inner & outer bounds
- 3 different methods of optimisation to determine Racing Line of least curviture (all WIP)
- Export functionality which will output track limits & racing line x y coordinates to a txt file

** Disclaimer - the focus of this project was working with OOP GUI creation, therefore use the optimisation tools with caution!!
